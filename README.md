# CYBER-ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLER EMULATOR
### **DESCRIPTION**
The *Cyber-Assembly Assembler Emulator* is a Batch program created to emulate the function of the **Cyber-Assembly 2.0 Assembler**. [Cyber-Assembly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/167ZkO1DiCTqaZYwqbe9dFA56oH-8F5ItjUlvjn_d4Ng/edit?usp=sharing) is a different take on real-life assembly language.

#### **CANCELLING DEVELOPMENT
Since Batch is such a confusing language to work with, the Batch version of the *Cyber-Assembly Assembler Emulator* will cease in development, and be replaced with Python. However, this will take time as the dev team consists of one singular individual.
